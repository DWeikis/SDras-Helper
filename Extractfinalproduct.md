# Final product

The final product has no dependencies so it is fully replicable to any other project.

All content is in **src/final/projectname**.

The folder contains everything necessary for the system to work integrated to any Vue project.

This is an example brought by the system.

The component is the center of the system, the css are included but the customization is contained in the component that is always copied from **final/basic** so if several projects are going to be done with a different aesthetics than the current one the component to be modified is **final/basic/helper.vue** and all future projects will have the modifications.

Within data there are folders divided by languages. The languages are in **languaje.json** and the data structure is in **structure.json**

We provide a [scaffolding](https://github.com/Gonzalo2310/skeleton-help) for testing.
