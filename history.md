##  Helper Product History

On December 27,2017 Sarah Drasner (@sdras) created an intuitive help for those who started JavaScript. This is the tweet I publish: https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/946091648773013504

Although the content was not the novelty but the way to reach the results. Sarah opted to make the questions more intuitive by creating a world of possibilities.

The tweet in question received 2212 retweets, 6320 favorites and 156 responses. Many ideas were generated in the answers and soon we saw the possibility of creating something like this for a multitude of contents because we are all new to many things and sometimes it is difficult to start from the technical side.

Although that was an explosion of activity I haven't really heard about any more versions of content using that system. Apart from the other help Sarah gave to those who started JS through this other tweet: https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/948219340096024576

We were facing a problem: the technical aspect.

Although the final idea was very good, the way to get to it was to modify code and files and that could be confusing for those who did not know JS or Vuejs.

A week after the publication of the tweet Sarah was asked what she thought of creating a system that would facilitate the creation of this type of aid.

Not only did he like the idea, but he also offered to help with whatever it took. I am very grateful for the feedback and support from Sarah.

During January and February this system has been developed for the first time for me of:

* A Node project ( 2 considering the file server)
* Project Vue complete
* Vuex and Vue-Route
* Working with files (writing, reading, creating, deleting and copying) from node
* Working with folders from node (create and delete)
* Open Source is publicly available.
